# Networking Configuration Checklist

☐ Open VirtualBox > Settings > Network
☐ Understand difference between NAT and Bridged Adapter
☐ Boot VM with NAT — confirm internet works via `ping google.com`
☐ Run `ip a` inside VM — locate IP address of active adapter
☐ From host, try: `ping <vm-ip>` (NAT will fail)
☐ Shutdown VM > Switch to Bridged Adapter > Start again
☐ Run `ip a` again and note new IP (usually 192.168.x.x)
☐ From host: `ping <vm-ip>` (Should now work)
☐ Start simple server: `python3 -m http.server`
☐ From host browser, test `http://<vm-ip>:8000`
☐ If not reachable:
   ☐ Check firewall (`sudo ufw status`)
   ☐ Confirm both machines on same Wi-Fi
   ☐ Restart VM after setting changes
☐ (Optional) Try connecting from another device on your network
