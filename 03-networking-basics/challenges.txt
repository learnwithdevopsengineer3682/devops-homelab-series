# Networking Challenges

1. Disable all network adapters and try to `ping google.com`. What error do you get?
2. Switch to NAT, start the VM, and confirm that internet access works with `ping google.com`.
3. Find the VM's IP address using `ip a`. Can you ping it from your host machine?
4. Change to Bridged Adapter, restart the VM, and find the new IP.
5. Can you ping this IP from your host now?
6. Try running a simple HTTP server on the VM using: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
7. From your host machine, open a browser and visit: `http://<your-vm-ip>:8080`
8. Block access using `ufw enable` and test again.
9. Can you SSH into the VM from your host? Try: `ssh <user>@<vm-ip>`
10. (Bonus) Connect another device on your Wi-Fi (like your phone) and ping the VM's IP.
