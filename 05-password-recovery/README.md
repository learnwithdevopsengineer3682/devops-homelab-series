# Password Recovery Lab – Episode 5

Welcome to **Home Lab Ep 5**! In this lab, we face one of the most realistic DevOps scenarios: you’ve built your server, taken a break… and now you can’t remember the password.

This happens even to experienced engineers, and knowing how to recover gracefully is a key admin skill.

##  What You'll Learn

- How to access **Recovery Mode** in VirtualBox
- How to **reset a forgotten Linux password** from root shell
- Safety tips for using this technique responsibly
- Why this matters in real DevOps jobs and interviews

##  Real-World Value

- Recovering systems instead of rebuilding them is a **senior skill**
- Shows employers that you know **how Linux works under the hood**
- Helps avoid panic and wasted time in real incidents

##  Files Included

- `challenges.txt`: Practice and bonus recovery tasks
- `password-recovery-checklist.txt`: Clear, step-by-step walkthrough of the recovery process

## ⚠️ Ethical Note

This technique is only to be used on **systems you own or are authorized to recover**. Never attempt unauthorized access — use your knowledge to solve problems, not create them.
