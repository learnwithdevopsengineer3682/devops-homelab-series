# Password Reset Checklist (VM Locked Out)

☐ Power off the VM

☐ Start the VM and hold `Shift` or press `Esc` to access GRUB

☐ Select: “Advanced options for Ubuntu”

☐ Choose: “(recovery mode)” for the latest kernel

☐ In the recovery menu, choose: “root – Drop to root shell prompt”

☐ Mount the root filesystem as read/write:
   mount -o remount,rw /

☐ Reset the password:
   passwd <your-username>

☐ Enter and confirm the new password

☐ Type `reboot` to restart the VM

☐ Try logging in with the new password

☐ If issues arise:
   ☐ Did GRUB show up?
   ☐ Is your username correct?
   ☐ Was the mount step successful?

☐ Always use this technique only on machines you are authorized to control
