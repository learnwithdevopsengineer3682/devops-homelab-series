# Web Server Setup Lab – Episode 4

Welcome to **Home Lab Ep 4** – Today, you're going to launch your very first web server from scratch, on your virtual machine, and access it through your browser just like a real-world DevOps engineer.

##  What You'll Learn

- Installing and running the **Nginx** web server on Ubuntu
- Troubleshooting SSH and firewall errors
- Accessing your VM web server from the host browser
- Understanding how requests travel from browser → firewall → server → back to your screen

##  Why This Matters

Every website runs on a web server. If you're aiming for roles in **DevOps**, **backend**, or **SysAdmin**, knowing how to configure and troubleshoot a real web server is a must.

This lab gives you confidence to not only run it, but **debug it when things go wrong** — which is what makes you stand out in interviews.
