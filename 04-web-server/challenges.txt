# Web Server Lab Challenges – Episode 4

1. SSH into your VM from your host PC using:
   ssh <username>@<vm-ip>

2. Install the OpenSSH server:
   sudo apt install openssh-server

3. Troubleshoot SSH connection errors (e.g., port 22 issues or missing host keys)

4. Install Nginx on the VM:
   sudo apt install nginx -y

5. Start and verify the service:
   sudo systemctl status nginx

6. Find your VM’s IP using:
   ip a

7. Open that IP in your host browser and verify you see the Nginx welcome page.

8. Customize the default homepage:
   sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

9. Add your name or custom message, then refresh the browser.

10. (Bonus) Try breaking Nginx:
    sudo systemctl stop nginx
    What happens? Can you recover it?
